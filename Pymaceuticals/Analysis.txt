From the graphs, we can determine that the Capomulin and Ramicane drugs were the most effective in reducing tumor size.
All the other drugs did not drastically reduce the size of the tumor volume.

In terms of mousse survival, Propriva was the worst where only around 25% of the mice survived.
This is much worse than the placebo group.
Again, the most successfull drugs are Capomulin and Ramicane.

The drugs that slowed tumor site growth were also Capomulin and Ramicane.
It should also be noted that all of the drugs did reduce the number of new metastatic sites.
